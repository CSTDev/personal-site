:wave: Hi, I'm Carl Taylor I help people solve problems by building better software.

#### What I Do For Work

I work with people to identify and discern business problems that are holding them back and help devise, design, and build software solutions using modern tech stacks. That doesn't just mean building new things! I've helped organisations refactor and improve existing systems to run on the cloud or in Kubernetes reducing costs and enabling scaling to meet their latest demands.

A lot of my recent work has been around data processing, taking huge quantities of data, extracting and enriching meaningful parts, and exporting it to users for further analysis.

Other than just creating I provide the necessary building blocks to create productive teams, be this through:

- :runner: using or improving Agile or Lean methods.
- :package: training on Docker and Kubernetes.
- :computer: battle-tested Ops tools deployments e.g. observability stacks, CI/CD.

#### Mentoring

> No one can do everything alone.

I enjoy working with people to help them improve be it in technical skills or understanding themselves and where they want to take their career.
I'm able to work with whole teams to define ways of working and increase velocity by focusing on the most effective areas of improvement. Equally, I've helped individuals improve their understanding and ability to produce high-quality solutions and decide where they fit in their world of work.

#### Beyond Work

- I can be found spending time with my wife and toddler daughter who never stops talking.
- I play basketball for a local team through the winter and in the summer I take all opportunities to go climbing.
- I'm learning the piano.
- Occasionally I tinker with a Raspberry PI or Arduino project. and have far more unfinished side projects than I should have!

#### What I'm Working On

Outside work my current side projects are:

- Soil moisture sensor - a wireless sensor to tell me when I need to water my house plants.
- TravelBug - micro-blogging travel app using Flutter.
- SimpleServiceInvoicing - a recurring invoicing system using AWS Amplify.
